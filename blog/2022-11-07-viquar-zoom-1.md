We met up with Dr. Viquar Qurashi, our partner from the Naya Quadam organization, and presented our progress to him.
Viquar told us how he helped an amputee boy who lost his hand in an accident while flying a kite.
In the absence of more fleshed-out solutions, Viquar got several items from a hardware store and constructed a prosthesis from these simple materials.
