We had a zoom call with Dr. Viquar Qurashi, our partner from the Naya Quadam organization, and presented our progress to him.
Viquar is an old friend of Sonja's family, and his organization has been providing leg prosthesis to people who cannot afford them free of charge for many years. 

Viquar told us how he helped a boy who lost his hand in an accident while flying a kite which touched an electric cable.
Dr. Qurashi was asked for help while on a visit in India, and in the absence of more fleshed-out solutions, he tackled the problem in a very practical way: He got several items from a hardware store and constructed a prosthesis from these simple materials.
We were quite impressed by his practical approach, which to us shows that even simple solutions can already make a big difference.
Another important takeaway from the meeting was that in Viquar's experience, for many amputees, having a cosmetic hand that looks as much as possible as a real human hand is the most important part.
