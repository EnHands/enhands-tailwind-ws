We had our
kickoff workshop to get EnHands started!
After meeting every few weeks for the last months to get a first idea and organization
for our group, we held a **full-day kickoff event** to get EnHands started.

We talked about our goals as a group, decided on our organizational structure and
assigned
the members into teams: Technical, Organization, Marketing, Finance


The rest is a bullshit blind-text written by ChatGPT.
EnHands is a student group comprised of individuals from various backgrounds, united by a shared
vision of designing affordable and accessible prosthetic hands for the developing world. We recently
held our first kick-off workshop, where we spent a whole day working together on different
activities aimed at achieving our mission.
At the start of the workshop, we introduced ourselves and shared our reasons for joining EnHands. We
talked about our interests, experiences, and the skills we could contribute to the team. This
ice-breaking session helped us bond and created a friendly atmosphere for the rest of the workshop.



After the introductions, we divided into smaller teams and began brainstorming ideas for our
prosthetic hands. We explored various materials and techniques that could be used to make the
prosthetic hands lightweight, durable, and cost-effective. We also discussed the design elements
that could make the prosthetic hands more functional, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing.
Once we had come up with our designs, we presented them to the rest of the group for feedback and
critique. We discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each design and how we could improve them. We
also talked about the different challenges we might encounter when designing the prosthetic hands,
such as the lack of resources and the need to consider cultural and social factors.



In the final part of the workshop, we came together to create a shared vision for EnHands. We
discussed our long-term goals, such as the number of prosthetic hands we aim to produce and the
regions we want to target. We also talked about our values and the principles that would guide our
work, such as the importance of collaboration, innovation, and social impact.



Overall, the kick-off workshop was a great success for EnHands. It brought us closer together and
provided a solid foundation for our future work. We left the workshop feeling energized, inspired,
and ready to take on the challenges of designing accessible prosthetic hands for the developing
world.
